<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Todays Progress**: Found 100 days of Code - setup Github for this.

Decided to finish the FCC Front End Certificate and worked FCC Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: After finishing my Bloc.io capstone I decided I needed something to keep me going on a day to day basis while starting my career. 100 days to code is perfect and should continue to let me grow professionally. Always something new to learn

### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Todays Progress**: Started the FCC Wikipedia Viewer project - Got ajax working and can get my json data. Will need to work on display tomorrow.

### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Todays Progress**:
  - Finished the FCC Wikipedia Viewer project
  - Completed 4 Algorithm challenges

**Thoughts**: I actually struggled a bit with the Wikipedia, displaying the JSON specifically, for whatever reason I kept putting the wrong incremental down. Still have issues with CSS, not the actual typing but just the decision of how it should look, a Web Designer I am not (yet) but hopefully it looks ok...
