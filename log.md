<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->

###Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Todays Progress**: Found 100 days of Code - setup Github for this.

Decided to finish the FCC Front End Certificate and worked FCC Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: After finishing my Bloc.io capstone I decided I needed something to keep me going on a day to day basis while starting my career. 100 days to code is perfect and should continue to let me grow professionally. Always something new to learn
