<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->

### Day 30: July 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC Calculator project completed.
Started on FCC Pomodoro Timer.

**Thoughts**

Had to go to a youtube video to figure this out. Sometimes I am beyond stubborn which can be a good thing. However, when trying to learn something chasing down the wrong road for so long can actually be hurtful in the learning process.

### Day 29: July 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC Calculator project continued, Added more styling, fixed some layout issues, trying to decide how to approach the CE button or exactly what to do with it.

### Day 28: July 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC Calculator project continued, behind on the curve and didn't like the way jQuery was looking so deleted it and using regular JS with onclick event. Cant seem to figure out the CE button yet.

**Thoughts:**

Had a mishap which resulted in my missing a few days due to a emergency...ie mistake with liquid that I am allergic too resulted in a couple days missed.

### Day 27: June 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC Calculator project continued

**Thoughts:**

Thought I could get it done but ran into serious issues. Came to a point that I kept trying to fix something but not thinking it through. Had to stop for now.

### Day 26: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC Calculator project started

**Thoughts:**

Felt that skipping the last of the FCC Front End Web Development wasnt that wise. Decided to finish that before heading through the Node course.

### Day 25: June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Continued WesBos Node.js course

**Thoughts:**

Started down a never ending rabbit hole which, while interesting, didnt help me achieve much more than information. ie I didnt get far into the Nodejs course.

### Day 24: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Started WesBos Node.js course

**Thoughts:**

Why is it that a setup of a new project is sometimes overwhelming. I know I can just use setup files they provide but I have to look through every line and at least get a basic understanding. It may be too much or I am going too deep at this stage but it bugs me not to have a global view of the project considering I am not the one that started it from scratch.

### Day 23: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC Advanced Algorithms all completed.

**Thoughts:**

While I did complete all the Advanced Algorithms I feal that there are more efficient ways to complete them. While I could do them over again I will just try and continue to do 1 Kata on Codewars every day.

### Day 22: June 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC Advanced Algorithms. Weekend Project is to get through WesBos NodeJS course.

### Day 21: June 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC Advanced Algorithms. Completed 'Exact Change' and started 'Inventory Update'.

### Day 20: June 21, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC Calculator, trying to find a bug when you realize that the , is actually a . and it took you like 40 minutes to realize that...ugh

### Day 19: June 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**

FCC algorithms everyday is starting to wear thin. Started one of the projects, calculator, in codepen for a change.

### Day 18: June 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Completed some updates and other minor edits on my Website. Completed the Advanced Algorithm Symmetric Difference through FCC, was a head scratcher for some reason.

### Day 16 & 17: June 17-18, 2017

**Weekends's Progress**

Spent the weekend going over code from Bloc projects and trying to determine what exactly my next step is. Worked on FCC Algorithms also.

### Day 15: June 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Advanced Algorithm Scripting through FCC...Got sidetracked when looking up something and spent 30+ minutes reading up on binary's...that doesn't even pertain to what I was doing.

### Day 14: June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Back to FCC Algorithms, at Advanced Algorithm Scripting....and I got the case of the duh's

### Day 13: June 14, 2017

**Skipped one day**
_Yes I skipped a day, this is due to my finishing the Bloc.io curriculum and wanted to take a day off._

**Today's Progress**

After taking 1 day off spent 2 hours doing algorithms which was actually needed. Completed the FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting portion.


### Day 12: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Break from FCC Algorithms, getting acquainted with Mocha for testing.

### Day 11: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Not much to repost as I have just continued with FCC Algorithms.

### Day 10: June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Completed a couple more of the FCC Algorithms but am slowing down because some of these are Math and I havent been in school for over 2 decades so I had to go to Khan Academy and brush up on some explanations...lol

### Day 9: June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Completed a couple of FCC Algorithms but stopped at a Fibonacci one as I am not sure how to do the logic yet.

### Day 8: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Finished the FCC Twitch API Project - After realizing my Design skills are not...art level I decided that simple styling with odd colors is good for right now. I am fine with just being able to get the logic down instead of worrying if my Color pallet is good or my design is 'user friendly'.

### Day 7: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Working on the FCC Twitch API Project - My Design skills are severely lacking...ie I couldn't make a rose look good.

### Day 6: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Almost complete with the Twitch API project through FCC. Have some minor CSS and a issue with URL that maybe a CORS issue but still some troubleshooting to go.

### Day 5: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Figured out how to separate some of the logic for the API to show who is on-line and off line. Will work on finishing out the JS and CSS tomorrow, possibly next 2 days.

**Thoughts**

Even if you do not think you are making progress because nothing seems to be working, at least you tried and won't have to try that 'dead end' again! You never learn anything from not trying...

### Day 4: June 4, 2017

**Todays Progress**

Not much actually, started with the FCC Twitchtv JSON API Project and got stopped by the actual API Documentation due to API Changes. I believe I have it figured out but after 3hrs figured it would be better to stop.

### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Todays Progress**:
  - Finished the FCC Wikipedia Viewer project
  - Completed 4 Algorithm challenges

**Thoughts**: I actually struggled a bit with the Wikipedia, displaying the JSON specifically, for whatever reason I kept putting the wrong incremental down. Still have issues with CSS, not the actual typing but just the decision of how it should look, a Web Designer I am not (yet) but hopefully it looks ok...

### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Todays Progress**: Started the FCC Wikipedia Viewer project - Got ajax working and can get my json data. Will need to work on display tomorrow.

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Todays Progress**: Found 100 days of Code - setup Github for this.

Decided to finish the FCC Front End Certificate and worked FCC Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: After finishing my Bloc.io capstone I decided I needed something to keep me going on a day to day basis while starting my career. 100 days to code is perfect and should continue to let me grow professionally. Always something new to learn
