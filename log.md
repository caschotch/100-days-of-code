<!-- # 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link to work:** [Calculator App](http://www.example.com) -->

### Day 15: June 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Advanced Algorithm Scripting through FCC...Got sidetracked when looking up something and spent 30+ minutes reading up on binary's...that doesn't even pertain to what I was doing.

### Day 14: June 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Back to FCC Algorithms, at Advanced Algorithm Scripting....and I got the case of the duh's

### Day 13: June 14, 2017

**Skipped one day**
_Yes I skipped a day, this is due to my finishing the Bloc.io curriculum and wanted to take a day off._

**Today's Progress**

After taking 1 day off spent 2 hours doing algorithms which was actually needed. Completed the FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting portion.


### Day 12: June 12, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Break from FCC Algorithms, getting acquainted with Mocha for testing.

### Day 11: June 11, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Not much to repost as I have just continued with FCC Algorithms.

### Day 10: June 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Completed a couple more of the FCC Algorithms but am slowing down because some of these are Math and I havent been in school for over 2 decades so I had to go to Khan Academy and brush up on some explanations...lol

### Day 9: June 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Completed a couple of FCC Algorithms but stopped at a Fibonacci one as I am not sure how to do the logic yet.

### Day 8: June 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Finished the FCC Twitch API Project - After realizing my Design skills are not...art level I decided that simple styling with odd colors is good for right now. I am fine with just being able to get the logic down instead of worrying if my Color pallet is good or my design is 'user friendly'.

### Day 7: June 7, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Working on the FCC Twitch API Project - My Design skills are severely lacking...ie I couldn't make a rose look good.

### Day 6: June 6, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Almost complete with the Twitch API project through FCC. Have some minor CSS and a issue with URL that maybe a CORS issue but still some troubleshooting to go.

### Day 5: June 5, 2017

**Today's Progress**

Figured out how to separate some of the logic for the API to show who is on-line and off line. Will work on finishing out the JS and CSS tomorrow, possibly next 2 days.

**Thoughts**

Even if you do not think you are making progress because nothing seems to be working, at least you tried and won't have to try that 'dead end' again! You never learn anything from not trying...

### Day 4: June 4, 2017

**Todays Progress**

Not much actually, started with the FCC Twitchtv JSON API Project and got stopped by the actual API Documentation due to API Changes. I believe I have it figured out but after 3hrs figured it would be better to stop.

### Day 3: June 3, 2017

**Todays Progress**:
  - Finished the FCC Wikipedia Viewer project
  - Completed 4 Algorithm challenges

**Thoughts**: I actually struggled a bit with the Wikipedia, displaying the JSON specifically, for whatever reason I kept putting the wrong incremental down. Still have issues with CSS, not the actual typing but just the decision of how it should look, a Web Designer I am not (yet) but hopefully it looks ok...

### Day 2: June 2, 2017

**Todays Progress**: Started the FCC Wikipedia Viewer project - Got ajax working and can get my json data. Will need to work on display tomorrow.

### Day 1: June 1, 2017

**Todays Progress**: Found 100 days of Code - setup Github for this.

Decided to finish the FCC Front End Certificate and worked FCC Algorithms.

**Thoughts**: After finishing my Bloc.io capstone I decided I needed something to keep me going on a day to day basis while starting my career. 100 days to code is perfect and should continue to let me grow professionally. Always something new to learn
